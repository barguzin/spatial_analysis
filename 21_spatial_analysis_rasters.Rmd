# Raster Processing Basics 

Please refer to [Neon Project](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/raster-data-r) for more details and R-code examples. Many definitions came from USGS and geodetics.com.

## Terminology 

- A DEM (Digital Elevation Model) Represents the bare-Earth surface, removing all natural and built features;
- A DSM (Digital Surface Model) captures both the natural and built/artificial features of the environment, as shown below;
- A DTM (Digital Terrain Model)  typically augments a DEM, by including vector features of the natural terrain, such as rivers and ridges. A DTM may be interpolated to generate a DEM, but not vice versa.
- Hillshade: Shaded relief, or hillshading, is a technique where a lighting effect is added to a map based on elevation variations within the landscape.

## Terrain Model 

```{r echo=F, message=F}

# load the raster, sp, and rgdal packages
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

DEM <- raster('~/Downloads/NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif')
DEM

DEM <- setMinMax(DEM)

cat("Range:")
cellStats(DEM, range)

```

## Projections Refresher 

<a> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Utm-zones-USA.svg"> </a>

```{r echo=F}

hist(DEM, main="Distribution of elevation values", xlab='elevation,m',
     col= "forestgreen", 
     maxpixels=22000000)

```

## Plotting raster 

```{r echo=F}

plot(DEM, 
         main="Digital Elevation Model, SJER") # add title with main

```


## Same picture, more pixels

```{r echo=F}

# create a plot of our raster
image(DEM)

```


## Filter values and plot 

```{r echo=F}

# specify the range of values that you want to plot in the DEM
# just plot pixels between 250 and 300 m in elevation
image(DEM, zlim=c(450,520))

```


## Use colors from terrain palette 

```{r echo=F}

# we can specify the colors too
col <- terrain.colors(5)
image(DEM, zlim=c(250,375), main="Digital Elevation Model (DEM)", col=col)

```

## Would be nice to add a legend 

```{r echo=F}

# add a color map with 5 colors
col=terrain.colors(5)

# add breaks to the colormap (6 breaks = 5 segments)
brk <- c(250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500)

plot(DEM, col=col, breaks=brk, main="DEM with more breaks")

```

## Fewer breaks

```{r echo=F}

#add a color map with 4 colors
col=terrain.colors(4)
#add breaks to the colormap (6 breaks = 5 segments)
brk <- c(200, 300, 350, 400,500)
plot(DEM, col=col, breaks=brk, main="DEM with fewer breaks")

```

## Using *spplot* R-library for plotting 

```{r echo=F}

spplot(DEM)

```

## Creating more aesthetic maps with layering and shadowing 

```{r echo=F}

# CREATE SJER DTM MAP
# import DTM 
DTM_SJER <- raster("~/Downloads/NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTM.tif")
# import DTM hillshade
DTM_hill_SJER <- 
  raster("~/Downloads/NEON-DS-Field-Site-Spatial-Data/SJER/DigitalTerrainModel/SJER2013_DTMHill.tif")

# plot hillshade using a grayscale color ramp that looks like shadows.
plot(DTM_hill_SJER,
    col=grey(1:100/100),  #create a color ramp of grey colors
    legend=F,
    main="DTM with Hillshade\n NEON SJER Field Site",
    axes=FALSE)

# add the DSM on top of the hillshade
plot(DTM_SJER,
     col=terrain.colors(100),
     alpha=0.4,
     add=T,
     legend=F)

```

# ArcGIS Model Builder 

## Why use model builder? 

- repetitive and tedious tasks 
- reproducibility 

## Automating 

- Writing a program (Classical text-based programming versus visual programming)

##
> ModelBuilder is a **visual programming language** for building geoprocessing workflows. Geoprocessing models automate and document your spatial analysis and data management processes. You create and modify geoprocessing models in ModelBuilder, where a model is represented as a diagram that chains together sequences of processes and geoprocessing tools, using the output of one process as the input to another process. 

## ModelBuilder in ArcGIS Pro allows you to do the following:

- Build a model by adding and connecting data and tools.
- Iteratively process every feature class, raster, file, or table in a workspace.
- Visualize your workflow sequence as an easy-to-understand diagram.
- Run a model step by step, up to a selected step, or run the entire model.
- Make your model into a geoprocessing tool that can be shared or can be used in Python scripting and other models.

## The model runs the following tools in sequence:

- Select Layer By Attributeâ€”Select the correct vegetation type from a Vegetation map layer.
- Bufferâ€”Create areas within a distance of 1,500 feet around major roads.
- Eraseâ€”Erase the buffer areas from the selected vegetation areas.
- Intersectâ€”Overlay the output of the Erase tool with other map layers, including slope, elevation, and climate. This identifies the areas that meet all criteria.
